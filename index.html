  <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    My journey into web development started back in <strong>2010</strong> while I was exploring the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Driven by curiosity and a passion to build for the web, I began developing small static websites for local businesses in Patna. As I gained hands-on experience, I quickly expanded my skills into WordPress, PHP, and server management.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>2012</strong>, I founded <a href="https://mauryahosting.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Maurya Hosting</strong></a> ‚Äî a web solutions company that began as a basic hosting provider and evolved into a full-service digital agency. We provided website design, development, SEO, and mobile app services to over 1,000 clients across India, helping businesses grow and scale online.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <strong>2024</strong>, I joined <strong>Aphro eCommerce Solutions</strong> as a Frontend Developer. This marked a focused shift into modern frontend development. At Aphro, I build responsive and optimized e-commerce websites using WordPress, Shopify, and JavaScript frameworks ‚Äî always with a strong emphasis on UI/UX, accessibility, and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    From building my first static webpage to delivering complex client solutions and contributing to open-source communities, my journey reflects a consistent drive for learning, quality, and innovation in web development.
