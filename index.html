  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Parmanand Jha</strong> — a Web Developer based in New Delhi with over 7 years of professional experience in WordPress, Shopify, SEO, and frontend technologies like Vue.js and React.js.</p>

  <p>My journey began in <strong>2010</strong> when I built my first static site. In <strong>2012</strong>, I founded <a href="https://mauryahosting.com" target="_blank">Maurya Hosting</a>, where we delivered digital solutions to hundreds of clients across India as a small but dedicated team.</p>

  <p>Leading Maurya Hosting until <strong>2017</strong> helped me build a deep understanding of scalable web hosting, domain management, client service, and website deployment at scale. I worked with developers and designers to deliver reliable and fast-loading websites that supported small businesses online.</p>

  <p>In <strong>2017</strong>, I moved to <strong>New Delhi</strong> to pursue better career opportunities and focus on full-time roles in professional environments. Since then, I’ve worked with companies like <strong>Zee Laboratories Ltd.</strong>, <strong>DigiiMento Educational Services Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, and currently, I am a full-time frontend developer at <strong>Aphro eCommerce Solutions Pvt. Ltd.</strong>.</p>

  <p>My core strengths include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>⚙️ WordPress & Shopify development</li>
    <li>💡  Clean, responsive UI with a focus on UX</li>
    <li>🔍 SEO strategies (On-page, Off-page, Analytics)</li>
    <li>📧 Email marketing with Mailchimp and Brevo</li>
    <li>📦 E-commerce integration with WooCommerce and OpenCart</li>
    <li>🧩 Running paid ads on Google, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I am passionate about continuous learning, writing clean code, and building web solutions that solve real problems. Let's connect if you're interested in discussing frontend trends, digital growth strategies, or UX best practices!</p>
